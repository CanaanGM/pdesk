# 0001. Settings file for workspaces, shortcuts and indicator

**Date**: 2026-10-22
**Updated**: 2026-10-28, settings moved to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pdesk` by [spec 0008](../0008-run-pdesk-as-admin/index.md)
**Status**: In Progress

## Summary

pdesk gets one `settings.toml` file in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pdesk`, the same folder as its log and layout. It holds the workspace count, the switch shortcuts, the indicator timing, and an on/off switch for the Copilot key remap. pdesk reads it once at start, so you restart pdesk after an edit. A broken value only resets that one setting (the log says which), a broken file resets everything, and pdesk always starts.

## Requirements

**User stories**:
- As the pdesk user, I want to change the workspace count, shortcuts and indicator timing in a file so that I don't have to rebuild.
- As the pdesk user, I want a mistake in the file to cost me one setting at most, with a log line telling me what went wrong.

**Acceptance criteria**:
- **AC-1**: If `settings.toml` does not exist in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pdesk`, pdesk writes the commented default file there on start, and behaves exactly as it does today.
- **AC-2**: pdesk never overwrites or rewrites an existing `settings.toml`.
- **AC-3**: With `workspaces = N` (2 to 9), after a restart every screen has N workspaces, the indicator shows N dots, and switching stops at workspace N.
- **AC-4**: After you lower the count, windows that `state.txt` lists on a workspace that no longer exists are shown on the next start; none stay cloaked.
- **AC-5**: Every shortcut in `[shortcuts] previous` and `next` switches the screen under the mouse. A combo matches only when exactly its modifiers are held. A combo that is not listed is no longer swallowed and reaches Windows normally.
- **AC-6**: An invalid entry in a shortcut list is dropped and logged; the valid entries still work. If no valid entry is left, that action uses its default.
- **AC-7**: If the same combo appears under both `previous` and `next`, both actions use their defaults and the clash is logged.
- **AC-8**: `[indicator] enabled = false` shows no popup. `hold_ms` and `fade_ms` set how long the popup holds and how long it fades.
- **AC-9**: `copilot_as_right_ctrl = false` lets the Copilot key through untouched.
- **AC-10**: A value with the wrong type or out of range makes only that setting fall back to its default; the log names the key, the problem, and the default used. Every other setting still applies.
- **AC-11**: A file that is not valid TOML makes pdesk use all defaults and log the parser's message (with its line number). pdesk still starts.
- **AC-12**: An unknown key is ignored with a warning in the log.
- **AC-13**: At start the log shows the settings path and the effective value of every setting.

## Decision

**Chosen option**: Option 1: TOML, parsed into a table and read key by key.

pdesk reads `settings.toml` from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pdesk` once at start into an immutable `Settings`. Bad values fall back one setting at a time; bad TOML falls back to all defaults; problems go to the log.

## Feature design

**Data model sketch**:

`settings.toml` (the default file, written verbatim when missing; the comments are part of it):
```toml
# pdesk settings. Restart pdesk after editing.

workspaces = 4              # 2 to 9, every screen
copilot_as_right_ctrl = true

[shortcuts]
# Keep these two if you switch with the touchpad swipe.
previous = ["Win+Ctrl+Left"]
next     = ["Win+Ctrl+Right"]

[indicator]
enabled = true
hold_ms = 550               # 0 to 5000
fade_ms = 200               # 0 to 2000
```

`Settings` (in `src/settings.rs`, all fields required, filled from defaults when missing or bad):

| Field | Type | Default | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `workspaces` | `usize` | 4 | 2 to 9 |
| `copilot_as_right_ctrl` | `bool` | true | |
| `previous` | `Vec<Combo>` | `[Win+Ctrl+Left]` | 1 or more valid entries |
| `next` | `Vec<Combo>` | `[Win+Ctrl+Right]` | 1 or more valid entries, none shared with `previous` |
| `indicator_enabled` | `bool` | true | |
| `hold_ms` | `u32` | 550 | 0 to 5000 |
| `fade_ms` | `u32` | 200 | 0 to 2000 |

`Combo { mods: u8, vk: u16 }`. `mods` is a bit set of Win, Ctrl, Alt, Shift. Shortcut text: parts joined by `+`, any order, any case. Modifiers `Win`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift` mean either side of the keyboard. Exactly one key, one of: `Left Right Up Down`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, `F1` to `F24`, `Home End PageUp PageDown Insert Delete Space Enter Tab Escape`. At least one modifier, no part repeated.

`ws.rs` `Monitor.hidden` changes from `[Vec<isize>; WORKSPACES]` to `Vec<Vec<isize>>` of length `settings::get().workspaces`; the `WORKSPACES` constant goes away. The `state.txt` format is unchanged.

**State transitions**: none. Settings are read once and never change while pdesk runs.

**API surface** (module functions; no network or CLI surface):

| Surface | Kind | Inputs | Outputs | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `settings::load()` | called once in `main` after `indicator::init()`, before `ws::load()` and `keys::spawn` | `settings.toml` in `ws::data_dir()` | fills the `OnceLock`; log lines | missing file: write defaults (write failure: log, use defaults) · bad TOML: all defaults · bad key: that key's default |
| `settings::get()` | `&'static Settings` | none | the settings | before `load()`: defaults (never panics) |
| `keys::handle` | hook | vk, up | swallow or pass | none |
| `ws::switch` / `ws::load` | main thread | `workspaces` | clamp, Vec size, shrink handling | none |
| `indicator::show` | main thread | `indicator_enabled`, `hold_ms`, `fade_ms` | popup or nothing | none |

**Value sourcing**:

| Action | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| load | file path | `ws::data_dir()` (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\pdesk`, created if missing) + `settings.toml`. The installed copy and `cargo run` share this one file. It used to be the exe's folder; spec 0008 moved it because the installed exe now lives in Program Files, where you cannot write. |
| load | default file text | `const DEFAULT_FILE: &str` in `settings.rs` |
| load | each setting | the TOML key, else `Settings::default()` |
| load | log line text | `settings: <key>: <problem>, using default <value>` · `settings: not valid TOML (<toml error>), using all defaults` · `settings: unknown key <key>, ignored` · `settings: wrote defaults to <path>` · `settings: <path>: <every effective value>` |
| hook match | held modifiers | `GetAsyncKeyState` of `VK_LWIN`/`VK_RWIN`, `VK_CONTROL`, `VK_MENU`, `VK_SHIFT` at the event (today's `held()`); the Copilot remap's injected Right Ctrl counts as Ctrl |
| hook match | direction | which list the matched combo is in: `previous` = -1, `next` = +1, posted as `WM_APP` as today |
| switch | workspace count | `settings::get().workspaces` |
| load (state) | where a saved window goes | its workspace < count: as today; workspace ≥ count: shown, like a window from a gone screen. A saved active ≥ count is ignored (active 0) |
| indicator | fade step per 16 ms tick | `ceil(OPAQUE / max(1, fade_ms / 16))`; `fade_ms = 0` hides on the first tick after the hold |
| indicator | hold | `hold_ms` passed to `SetTimer` (0 gives Windows' 10 ms minimum) |

**Key invariants**:
- `Settings::default()` equals what parsing `DEFAULT_FILE` produces, with no warnings.
- Every `Settings` value pdesk runs with is in range; nothing out of range reaches `ws`, `keys` or `indicator`.
- `previous` and `next` are never empty and share no combo.
- Every window in `state.txt` is either adopted into a workspace that exists or shown. None is left cloaked without being tracked.
- The hook thread never touches the file and never blocks; it only reads `settings::get()`.

**Security model**: a local file in a folder only your user account can write, read by pdesk, which runs as admin since spec 0008. It holds no secrets and must never name a program to run or a file to load as code, since anything running as you can edit it (spec 0008 invariant). A bad edit can only change pdesk's own keys and timing.

**Configuration required**: no new environment variables or credentials. One new crate, `toml` (add with `cargo add toml` to get the current version; it brings `serde` along).

**Critical test scenarios**:
- Happy path: set `workspaces = 3`, add `"Alt+Ctrl+Left"` to `previous`, restart: three dots, both previous combos switch, the swipe still works. Verifies AC-3, AC-5.
- Failure case: with windows hidden on workspace 4, set `workspaces = 2` and restart: those windows are visible. Verifies AC-4.
- Failure case: break the file (`workspaces = = 4`), restart: pdesk runs on defaults and the log shows the TOML error with its line. Verifies AC-11.
- Failure case: `workspaces = 12` and `hold_ms = "long"`: both use defaults with log lines; the other settings apply. Verifies AC-10.
- Unit test: `DEFAULT_FILE` parses to `Settings::default()` with zero warnings. Verifies AC-1.
- Permission: not applicable (single user local file).

## Build plan

Tracer Bullet: first one setting all the way from file to behavior, then the others.

1. `cargo add toml`. Create `src/settings.rs` (file header comment per AGENTS.md): path next to the exe (since moved to the data folder by spec 0008), write `DEFAULT_FILE` when missing, parse to a table, read `workspaces` with its range check, warn on unknown keys, all defaults on bad TOML, `OnceLock` plus `get()`, the startup summary line. Call `settings::load()` from `main`. Satisfies **AC-1**, **AC-2**, **AC-10**, **AC-11**, **AC-12**, **AC-13**.
2. `ws.rs`: drop `WORKSPACES`, make `hidden` a `Vec` sized from settings, use the count in `switch` and the `println!` in `main`, show saved windows whose workspace is gone in `load`. Satisfies **AC-3**, **AC-4**.
3. Add a `#[test]` that `DEFAULT_FILE` parses to `Settings::default()` with no warnings. Satisfies **AC-1**.
4. Indicator keys: read `enabled`, `hold_ms`, `fade_ms`; replace `HOLD_MS` and the fixed fade step. Satisfies **AC-8**, **AC-10**.
5. Copilot switch: skip the Copilot handling in `keys::handle` when `copilot_as_right_ctrl` is false. Satisfies **AC-9**.
6. Shortcuts: parse combos (drop bad entries, defaults when empty or when `previous` and `next` clash), and replace the hard coded arrow match in `keys::handle` with an exact match against both lists, sending `VK_MASK` for Win or Alt combos. Satisfies **AC-5**, **AC-6**, **AC-7**.
7. Try it by hand on your screens with the scenarios above, then run `install.ps1`. Satisfies **AC-1** to **AC-13**.

## Consequences

**Positive**:
- You change the count, keys and timing without a rebuild; `install.ps1` only copies the exe, so your file survives updates.
- One function per key keeps every problem message specific.
- The project gets its first unit test, guarding the one place two copies of the defaults could drift apart.

**Negative / tradeoffs**:
- First dependency besides `windows`: `toml` and `serde` add a few crates and some clean build time.
- Changes need a restart; there is no live reload.
- `cargo run` reads `target\debug\settings.toml`, a different file from the installed copy's.
- Mistakes only show in `pdesk.log`; nothing pops up.
- Exact modifier matching changes today's behavior: `Win+Ctrl+Shift+Left` no longer switches.
- Dropping `Win+Ctrl+Left/Right` from the lists silently breaks the touchpad swipe until the Windows gesture is changed too.

**Neutral**:
- `state.txt` keeps its format; a smaller count only changes how `load` treats old lines.

## Follow-up

- [ ] For `/sync`: AGENTS.md needs `src/settings.rs`, the settings path, `cargo test` (tests now exist), and a `rust-serde` bullet under `## Agent skills` noting that this spec deliberately departs from its fail whole read advice.
- [ ] Feature 8 (tray icon): its "Open settings" item opens this file.
- [ ] Features 4, 5 and 6 add their own lists under `[shortcuts]` with the same combo syntax and the same clash rule across all actions.
