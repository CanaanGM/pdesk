# Rationale: 0007. Window finder: a search popup that lands you on any window, on any screen and workspace

Build spec: [index.md](index.md).

## Context

With three screens and four workspaces each, pdesk can hide a window in any of twelve places. Switching, follow activation, and jump and send by number all assume you remember where a window is. When you don't, the only way back is to step through workspaces on each screen until it shows up. Windows' own Alt+Tab and Task View don't help: pdesk hides windows by cloaking them (a shell flag that makes a window invisible without closing or minimizing it), and both of those skip cloaked windows.

What you want is the way you find things on a Mac or in GNOME: press a key, type a few letters of the window or the app, press Enter, and you are there. "There" means pdesk's own idea of place: the right screen switched to the right workspace, with the window focused. Only pdesk knows which workspace holds a hidden window, so whatever finds windows has to read pdesk's state, and landing on one has to go through pdesk's own switch.

This is also the first pdesk window that takes keyboard focus. The dots indicator never does. Windows limits which process may bring a window to the front (the foreground lock), so the popup only works if pdesk is allowed to take focus right after the shortcut. pdesk already counts as the last input source after a Win shortcut, because the hook injects the `VK_MASK` key, and `switch_to` already sets focus successfully today.

Two facts about Windows shape the edges. A program that is not running as admin cannot send most messages to an admin window (UIPI, User Interface Privilege Isolation), so closing or perhaps moving an admin window from pdesk can fail. And a window moved between screens with different scaling may resize itself when Windows tells it the scaling changed (`WM_DPICHANGED`), which can undo a size pdesk just set.

## Options considered

### Option 1: pdesk's own finder popup, fed by pdesk's state

A new module `src/finder.rs` owns a dark popup with a text box and a list it paints itself. It lists windows from `ws` state, ranks them with a fuzzy matcher crate, and lands on a window through new `ws` functions that reuse `switch_to`.

**Pros**:
- Sees hidden windows and knows their screen and workspace, because it reads the same state that hid them.
- Landing reuses `switch_to`, so a finder jump behaves exactly like a switch (bottom first hiding, the indicator, saving to `state.txt`).
- One process, one message loop, one look, matching the indicator.

**Cons**:
- The most new UI code pdesk has had: a focusable popup, painting, keyboard routing, icons.
- The main loop has to learn `TranslateMessage` and a key filter for the popup.
- Relies on Windows letting pdesk take focus.

### Option 2: An existing launcher (PowerToys Command Palette or Run with its window walker)

Use a launcher you may already have, which lists open windows and switches to the one you pick. Follow activation (spec 0002) would then switch pdesk's workspace when the picked window comes to the front.

**Pros**:
- No pdesk UI code at all, and a polished, maintained search box.

**Cons**:
- These walkers skip cloaked windows, which is every window pdesk hides, so the windows you most need to find never appear.
- No screen or workspace label, and no bring here action, because the launcher knows nothing about pdesk.
- Depends on another tool being installed and kept compatible.

### Option 3: A popup built with a GUI crate (egui or Slint)

Same behavior as Option 1, but the popup is drawn by a GUI library instead of plain Win32.

**Pros**:
- Ready made text input, lists, scrolling and styling.

**Cons**:
- A large dependency and its own window and event loop next to pdesk's plain Win32 loop, against the project's minimal stack in `AGENTS.md`.
- Focus, DPI and topmost behavior go through another layer, harder to reason about when something breaks.

## Rationale

Option 1 is the only one that can see hidden windows, which is the whole point of the feature: a finder that can't list cloaked windows finds only what you can already see. It also keeps pdesk's rule that all window changes happen on the main thread through `ws`, so a finder jump can't disagree with a switch about where a window lives. Option 3 would buy nicer widgets at the cost of a second UI stack in a tool that has deliberately stayed on plain Win32 with two dependencies.

Inside Option 1, three smaller calls were made with you:

- **Text box: Windows' own EDIT control, borderless and styled dark.** You first leaned toward drawing the box, then asked for a caret, Left/Right, paste, Ctrl+Backspace and IME (the input method that composes Chinese, Japanese or Korean text). The EDIT control gives all of those for free, and inside pdesk's own painted frame it looks drawn. Drawing it ourselves would have been about 250 more lines, IME included, for the same result. Runner up: drawing it but dropping the caret and IME.
- **Matching: the `nucleo-matcher` crate (0.3.1).** You chose fuzzy matching (letters in order, not adjacent), and good fuzzy ranking is fiddly to tune: word starts, runs of letters, case. The crate is the matcher from the Helix editor, pure Rust, small. Its last release is from February 2024, which is acceptable for a finished algorithm with no outside dependencies. Runner up: our own scorer of about 60 lines, if the crate ever becomes a problem.
- **Order: recently used first.** A fuzzy query like "chrome" often matches several windows equally; the one you used last is almost always the one you want, and starting on the second row makes Win+F then Enter flip between your last two windows from anywhere, like Alt+Tab. This needs the foreground hook installed always, not only when `follow_activation` is on, which costs nothing measurable. Recency stays in memory: losing it on restart is fine, saving it would tie it into restore for little gain.

Decisions made at write time (your call to override):

- **Haystack is "program title" in one string.** Then a query like "code pdesk" matches across both, since every word must match somewhere. Runner up: score program and title separately and take the best, which can't match one word in each.
- **Pattern without fzf syntax.** The crate's `Pattern::parse` treats `^`, `$`, `!` and `'` as operators; titles contain those characters, so the finder uses plain fuzzy atoms. Runner up: the full syntax, which would surprise more than it helps here.
- **Screen numbers left to right by each screen's left edge, then top edge.** Matches how you see your desk. Runner up: Windows' `DISPLAYn` numbers, which you rejected.
- **Upper third placement: the top of the popup at 20% of the work area height.** The list grows downward and the text box never moves.
- **At most 9 rows visible, then scrolling with the selection.** Fits a 150% laptop screen comfortably.
- **No wrap at the ends of the list.** Holding Down stops on the last row instead of jumping to the top unexpectedly.
- **Focus moves to the target before the popup hides.** If the popup hid first, Windows would pick some window to activate, possibly a hidden one, and follow activation would then switch to it.
- **Any pdesk switch, jump, send or screen change closes the finder first.** The list is a snapshot and would be stale after a switch.
- **Act on current state, not the snapshot.** Restore (spec 0003) may hide windows while the finder is open, so every action looks up where the window is now.
- **Icons: `WM_GETICON` with a 50 ms timeout that gives up at once on a frozen app, then the class icons, then the generic app icon.** A frozen app can never hang the popup.
- **Store apps: the program name of the hosted app.** Their frame window belongs to `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`; the real app owns a child window of class `Windows.UI.Core.CoreWindow`. When that child is missing (a suspended app), the name stays `ApplicationFrameHost`.
- **Moving across screens with different scaling: set the placement, then check the result and set the size once more.** This undoes an app's own resize on `WM_DPICHANGED`. Windows' own Win+Shift+Arrow, which you confirmed works well in spec 0006, is the bar to compare with.
- **A row disappears after Ctrl+W when the window is gone or no longer visible.** Apps that close to the tray hide their window instead of destroying it.
- **`finder = []` falls back to the default**, like every other shortcut list (spec 0001). There is no off switch; rebinding it to another combo gives Win+F back to Windows.
- **The Agent Skill found for the crate (`smithery.ai/nucleo-matcher`) was skipped.** It was unverified and almost unused; the spec names the few calls needed.
