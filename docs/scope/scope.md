# Scope: pdesk

pdesk gives Windows 11 per screen virtual desktops like macOS and GNOME: each screen switches its own workspaces, and the other screens stay put. It is a personal tool for one person on a laptop with external screens.

**Build approach:** Tracer Bullet (each feature is built completely, from shortcut to window behavior to saved layout, and works before the next one starts).
**Workflow:** Prototype (nothing runs after `/develop`; you try each feature on your own screens). The project default level of rigor. `/architect` is the recommended first stop for a feature with a real decision, but skippable when you already know the build. Any feature can carry its own tag (e.g. `· Alpha`) to do more or less.

_These are recommendations to keep your build orderly, not requirements. Skip anything that does not fit: if you already know how to build a feature, use `/develop` and skip `/architect`. You decide when a feature is `done`._

## Already built

### A. Per screen workspaces · existing
Four workspaces per screen, hidden through the shell's undocumented cloak call (works on admin windows too, no elevation needed). Windows are hidden bottom first so nothing flashes. code in `src/ws.rs`, `src/cloak.rs`

### B. Switching by keyboard and swipe · existing
Win+Ctrl+Left/Right switches the screen under the mouse through a low level keyboard hook on its own thread. The four finger swipe sends the same shortcut (set in Settings, Advanced gestures). code in `src/keys.rs`

### C. Copilot key as Right Ctrl · existing
The Copilot key (LWin, LShift, F23) becomes Right Ctrl, keeping any physically held Win or Shift, with no Start menu pop. code in `src/keys.rs`

### D. Taskbar follows the workspace · existing
Hidden windows lose their taskbar button and get it back when shown. code in `src/cloak.rs`

### E. Workspace indicator · existing
A dots popup in the middle of the switched screen, DPI aware, fades out. A redesign is wanted later (see Deferred). code in `src/indicator.rs`

### F. Autostart and install · in-progress
Release build with no console, one copy at a time, log file, `--quit`, and `install.ps1` that registers start at login. Built; starting at login has not been seen working yet. code in `src/main.rs`, `install.ps1`

### G. Layout survives restarts and undocking · in-progress
Saves each screen's workspace and every hidden window, and adopts them on start. Restart was confirmed working; showing a disconnected screen's hidden windows has not been tried yet. code in `src/ws.rs`

## Foundations

### 1. Coding standards and AGENTS.md · done
Capture how pdesk is built (raw COM vtable calls, the main thread vs hook thread split, never un-hide windows pdesk did not hide) so later features follow the same rules.
**Done when:** a root `AGENTS.md` describes the modules, the threading rules, and the safety rules the code already follows.
- [x] Capture conventions: `/audit`

### 2. Settings file · in-progress
One file for the shortcuts, the number of workspaces per screen, and indicator timing, so you can change them without rebuilding.
**Done when:** changing the workspace count or a shortcut in the file takes effect after a restart, and a broken file falls back to defaults with a line in the log.
spec [0001](../specs/0001-settings-file/index.md) · code in `src/settings.rs`
- [x] Design it (spec): `/architect settings file`
- [ ] Build it: `/develop settings file`
  - [x] Settings file loads and the workspace count works end to end (AC-1 to AC-4, AC-10 to AC-13)
  - [x] Indicator timing and the Copilot switch (AC-8, AC-9)
  - [x] Configurable shortcuts (AC-5 to AC-7)
  - [ ] Tried on your screens, then installed (all ACs)

## Slice 1: Follow activation

### 3. Follow activation · in-progress
When a hidden window comes to the front (an app reusing its window, a notification click, Alt+Tab), its screen jumps to that window's workspace, so nothing is ever active but invisible.
**Done when:** opening a `.txt` file while Notepad sits on a hidden workspace switches that screen to it, and the indicator shows the jump. (Photos opens a new window per image on this machine, so it cannot show this.)
spec [0002](../specs/0002-follow-activation/index.md) · code in `src/ws.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/settings.rs`
- [x] Design it (spec): `/architect follow activation`
- [ ] Build it: `/develop follow activation`
  - [x] Jump on activation end to end: switch by index, foreground hook, lookup, focus, save (AC-1 to AC-6, AC-10, AC-11)
  - [x] Cooldown, bounce guard, and the `follow_activation` setting (AC-7 to AC-9)
  - [ ] Tried on your screens, then installed (all ACs)

## Slice 2: Moving windows

### 4. Send window to workspace · done
Move the focused window to the previous or next workspace on its screen with a shortcut, optionally following it there.
**Done when:** the shortcut moves the window, the layout file records the new place, and the follow or stay behavior matches the spec.
spec [0004](../specs/0004-send-window-to-workspace/index.md) · code in `src/ws.rs`, `src/keys.rs`, `src/settings.rs`, `src/indicator.rs`, `src/main.rs`
- [x] Design it (spec): `/architect send window to workspace`
- [x] Build it: `/develop send window to workspace`
  - [x] Follow send end to end: settings, hook, wrap, saved layout (AC-1, AC-3, AC-4, AC-7, AC-8, AC-10, AC-12)
  - [x] Stay send with the focus move and the follow guard (AC-2, AC-9, AC-11, AC-12)
  - [x] Stay repeat, one action per press, accent dot (AC-2, AC-5, AC-6)
  - [x] Tried on your screens, then installed (all ACs)

### 5. Send window to screen · done
Move the focused window to another screen, landing on that screen's current workspace with a sensible size across different scaling.
**Done when:** a window sent between your 150% laptop screen and an external screen keeps a sensible size and position, and maximized windows stay maximized.
spec [0006](../specs/0006-send-window-to-screen.md) · no code: Windows' own Win+Shift+Left/Right does it, pdesk keeps that combo free
- [x] Design it (spec): `/architect send window to screen`
- [x] Tried on your screens (2026-10-28)

### 11. Jump and send by number · done
Go straight to workspace N with a shortcut, or send the focused window there, with or without following it.
**Done when:** Win+N jumps, Win+Shift+N and Win+Ctrl+N send, and the quick fix, too high and settings rules match the spec.
spec [0005](../specs/0005-jump-send-by-number/index.md) · code in `src/ws.rs`, `src/keys.rs`, `src/settings.rs`, `src/main.rs`
- [x] Design it (spec): `/architect jump and send by number`
- [x] Build it: `/develop jump and send by number`
  - [x] Jump end to end: settings, digit hook, too high and same workspace (AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, AC-7, AC-8, AC-9, AC-10)
  - [x] Numbered sends on the 0004 path, with the quick fix and guards (AC-3 to AC-10)
  - [x] Tried on your screens, then installed (all ACs)
  - [x] Default keys Win, Win+Shift, Win+Ctrl in the code and tests, then installed (AC-10)

## Slice 3: Window finder

### 6. Window finder · in-progress
A search popup listing every window on every workspace and screen. Type a few letters, press Enter, and you land on it.
**Done when:** the popup opens by shortcut, filters as you type, and Enter switches the right screen to the right workspace and focuses the window.
spec [0007](../specs/0007-window-finder/index.md) · code in `src/finder.rs`, `src/ws.rs`, `src/keys.rs`, `src/settings.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/restore.rs`
- [x] Design it (spec): `/architect window finder`
- [ ] Build it: `/develop window finder`
  - [x] Open, list and go end to end: setting, Win+F, popup, Enter on hidden and visible windows, closing (AC-1, AC-2, AC-7, AC-8, AC-11, AC-14)
  - [x] Finding and rows: fuzzy ranking, recency, program names, icons, navigation keys, click, notes, final look (AC-3 to AC-6, AC-12, AC-13)
  - [x] Shift+Enter brings a window to you, Ctrl+W closes it (AC-9, AC-10)
  - [ ] Tried on your screens, then installed (all ACs)

## Slice 4: Living with it

### 7. Alt+Tab per workspace · done
Alt+Tab only lists windows on the workspaces you can see right now.
**Done when:** hidden windows do not appear in Alt+Tab, and they come back to Alt+Tab when their workspace is shown again or pdesk quits.
spec [0009](../specs/0009-alt-tab-per-workspace.md) · no code: explorer already leaves cloaked windows out of Alt+Tab and Task View; hidden admin windows still show, and picking one follows to its workspace
- [x] Design it (spec): `/architect alt tab per workspace`

### 8. Tray icon · done
An icon near the clock showing pdesk is running, with Quit and Open log (and Open settings once the settings file exists).
**Done when:** the icon appears at start, Quit shows every window and exits, and the icon survives an explorer restart.
code in `src/tray.rs`, `src/main.rs`
- [x] Build it: `/develop tray icon`
  - [x] Tried on your screens: icon shows, Open settings and Open log work (2026-10-26)
  - [x] Still to try: Quit shows every window and exits, icon comes back after an explorer restart (2026-10-28, as admin)

### 12. Keys work over admin windows · in-progress · from spec 0008
pdesk runs as admin from a logon task, so an admin window with focus (Task Manager, an admin terminal) no longer stops its shortcuts, and Win+Ctrl+Right never falls through to Windows' own desktops.
**Done when:** with Task Manager focused, Win+Ctrl+Right switches pdesk's workspace, pdesk starts as admin at login with no prompt, and the exe lives in Program Files.
spec [0008](../specs/0008-run-pdesk-as-admin/index.md) · code in `install.ps1`, `src/main.rs`, `src/tray.rs`, `src/indicator.rs`, `src/settings.rs`
- [x] Design it (spec): `/architect admin windows`
- [ ] Build it: `/develop keys work over admin windows`
  - [x] Admin pdesk by hand: start log line, message filters, settings in the data folder, tried from an admin terminal (AC-1, AC-2, AC-5, AC-6, AC-7, AC-9)
  - [x] Install as admin: Program Files, logon task, one UAC prompt, cleanup, running check (AC-3, AC-4, AC-5, AC-10)
  - [ ] Editor opens as you, then tried on your screens after a sign out (AC-8, all ACs)

## Slice 5: Overview

### 9. Workspace overview · in-progress
A per screen view of all its workspaces as live thumbnails, like Task View but for one screen, to pick a workspace or a window.
**Done when:** the overview opens on the screen under the mouse, shows each workspace's windows, and clicking one switches there.
spec [0010](../specs/0010-workspace-overview/index.md) · code in `src/overview.rs`, `src/ws.rs`, `src/keys.rs`, `src/settings.rs`
- [x] Design it (spec): `/architect workspace overview`
- [ ] Build it: `/develop workspace overview`
  - [x] Hidden window preview check, then the thin thread: Win+Tab, a popup per screen, tiles, spread, click to go or switch (AC-1, AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, AC-12, AC-13, AC-14)
  - [x] Strip mini windows, near real place spread, cards, labels setting (AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-5)
  - [ ] Keys, selection, closing windows (AC-8, AC-9)
  - [ ] Drag and drop across screens (AC-7)
  - [ ] Live setting and animations, then tried on your screens and installed (AC-10, AC-11, all ACs)

## Deferred
Out of scope for the current build pass, kept so the plan stays honest.
- **Indicator redesign**: a nicer popup look, asked for later · needs a decision
- **Dynamic workspaces**: GNOME style, always one empty at the end (you chose a fixed count for now) · needs a decision
- **Native touchpad gestures**: read the touchpad through Raw Input instead of Settings shortcuts, only if the shortcut route ever falls short · needs a decision
- **Per app follow exclusions**: a `settings.toml` list of apps that never trigger follow activation, only if one keeps stealing focus (from spec 0002) · needs a decision
- **Dimmed wallpaper behind the overview**: draw your wallpaper instead of solid dark (from spec 0010) · needs a decision
- **Mouse wheel in the window finder**: scroll the finder's list with the wheel, only if the keys feel slow with many windows (from spec 0007) · needs a decision
- **Owned dialogs on hidden workspaces**: pdesk never hides a hidden window's dialogs, so they float over the wrong workspace; check when building feature 4 (from spec 0002) · needs a decision

## Legend

**The decision box.** Every feature carries exactly one, the sub task whose label ends with `(spec)`. Skills locate it by that `(spec)` suffix, never by an exact label. Every other box is an execution box and `/architect` never ticks one.

**Feature lifecycle**: the scope updates as a feature moves; each row is what it shows and who sets it:

| State | Set by | The feature shows |
|---|---|---|
| `planned` · needs a decision | `/scope` | one box: `Design it (spec): /architect <feature>` |
| `in-progress` (designed) | **`/architect` at spec capture** | `Design it` ticked; spec linked; `Build it: /develop <feature>` + **2 to 5 milestones** |
| `in-progress` (building) | `/develop` | milestone sub boxes tick one by one; code pointer filled |
| `done` | **you, when you decide it is**; `/sync` reconciles | with the Prototype workflow, the suggested point is right after `/develop`, once you have tried it |

- **Next step** = the first unticked box (always a command or a tracked milestone).
- **needs a decision** = run `/architect` first; otherwise straight to `/develop` (or `/audit` for standards). The tag drops once the spec is captured.
- **Atomic build tasks live in the spec's `## Build plan`, not here**: the scope carries only the milestone rollup.
- **Status** `planned` → `in-progress` → `done`, plus `existing` (built before this workflow) and `dropped` (de-scoped, kept for history).
- **Workflow tier tag** beside a heading (e.g. `· Alpha`) sets that one feature's rigor; no tag inherits the default.
- **Workflow** (header line) is the project default, what runs after `/develop`: **Prototype** = nothing (trust develop's own self check and your eye); **Alpha** = `/check verify`; **Beta** = `/check verify` then `/test`; **GA** = adds a fresh model `/check review` then `/document`.
- **Pointer line** (`spec <n> · code in <path>`): the spec link added by `/architect`, the code path by `/develop`.
